A triangle with vertices A, B, and C is denoted {\\displaystyle \\triangle ABC}\\triangle ABC.[1]\r\nIn Euclidean geometry, any three points, when non-collinear, determine a unique triangle and simultaneously, a unique plane (i.e. a two-dimensional Euclidean space). In other words, there is only one plane that contains that triangle, and every triangle is contained in some plane. \r\n\r\nGood to know when choosing a bar stool, if you see what I mean."

It is vital for all known forms of life, even though it provides no calories or organic nutrients. Its chemical formula H2O, indicates that each of its molecules contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, connected by covalent bonds."
